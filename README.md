===========

This project is a reimplementation of WarpOS for various PPC PCI cards for
the Zorro 3 big box Amigas.

It is a rewrite from assembly to (mostly) C of the SonnetAmiga project.

# Current State

Refer to the issues tracker for progress. Currently, the library is
in an early working beta stage for the K1/M1 cards.
